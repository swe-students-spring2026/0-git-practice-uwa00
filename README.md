## [Dustin Brett's Portfolio](dustinbrett.com)
A really interesting website relating to software developlment is a website created by [Dustin Brett](dustinbrett.com). It is essentially an OS (Operating System) simulator that mimics the behaviour of a traditional operating system, such as Windows.

It is a really impressive website; the graphics are extremely sharp and clear, the website's interactivity is incredibly smooth, and it has lots of amazing functionalities. You can tell that a lot of time and work has been put into this project. 

It has multiple different functionalities; text editors, media players, mini applications, a search function, a clock, etc. Just lots of features of an operating system but it runs directly in the browser! It is really pleasing aesthetically if that serves as its only true function, as well as providing some sense of nostalgic satisfaction. It is a truly creative project made just for the intention of Being A Cool Thing That Exists, which is something I defintely want to do in a project of my own.

Very impressive website! Really demonstrates how expansive software development can be!
